# My thoughts and Logic

I made my own version of a rock, paper, scissors game using Python.

You can find the "official" rules of the game on [the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/)

I used the ASCII art for the hand signals and saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. 

I Started the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

Those are the questions i asked myself for develop the game :

* How you will store the user's input.
* How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
* How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* And also how you will give feedback to the player.
